# NTIRE '2O: Sensor-realistic Synthetic Data Engine for Multi-frame High Dynamic Range Photography

## Get Started
- This repo examplifies several pure synthetic data we used in our work Sensor-realistic Synthetic Data Engine for Multi-frame High Dynamic Range Photography. Please refer to the paper for more details.

- The complete dataset can be downloaded at

## Synthetic Dataset Examples
### Synthetic Dataset 1
- This synthetic dataset is captured at two exposure levels statically and dynamically (i.e., static_ and dynamic_ at EV-3 (low) and EV0 (high)). We use a proprietary algorithm to compute the Blendmap first and then use the exposure fusion algorithm to generate the HDR ground-truth for this dataset.

### Synthetic Dataset 2
- This synthetic dataset is captured at three exposure levels statically and dynamically (i.e., static_ and dynamic_ at EV-2 (low), EV0 (mid), and EV2 (high)). We follow the linear triangular method to generate the HDR ground-truth for this dataset.
